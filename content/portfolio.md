# [The awakening (unfinished). Text based game](https://itf.github.io/the-awakening/)

[![img](./jpg/1596002418308854.jpg)](./jpg/1596002418308854.jpg)
2017- An experimental text based game inspired by “the space under the
window”, and by “A Dark Room”.

The user interacts with the text, and the text is written and rewritten
based on the interaction with the user.

The game is unfinished, and theres is only about 1 minute of gameplay at
the moment.

# [Facebook advertisement for Lazuli Motel](http://lazulimotel.com/)

[![img](./jpg/lazuli.jpg)](./jpg/lazuli.jpg)

2017- Created ad campaigns for the Lazuli Motel website I previously created
with a tight budget. For about $1 a day for 3 months, it brought
approximately 80 extra visitor to the website per day. The average time
spent per user on the website was 3 minutes.

It was not possible to analyze exactly how many clients the ad campaign
brought to the business, but given how many times the business got
contacted by phone during the ad campaign it seems that the campaign was
fairly successful.

<div class="portfolio-project">

# [Lazuli Motel Website and pictures](http://lazulimotel.com/)

[![img](./jpg/lazuli.jpg)](./jpg/lazuli.jpg)

2017- I took HDR pictures from the rooms of Lazuli Motel in Botuca, SP,
Brazil, and created a website for it, using Hugo as a static website
generator.

The website was intended to be accessed on 3g networks, so the image
quality and sizes were chosen in such a way to improve the user
experience, and it is also a single page website in order to not reload
already loaded information, and if the user's network fails, they can
still continue to see the information that has already been loaded.

</div>
<div class="portfolio-project">

# [Imagenet-download](https://github.com/itf/imagenet-download)

2016- A simple command line tool to download images from the imagenet dataset
while storing them with humanreadable names and ignoring images that are
too small.

</div>
<div class="portfolio-project">

# [Led Panel 30x60px](led_panel.md)

[![img](./png/cloudsRainbow.png)](./png/cloudsRainbow.png)

2016- My friends and I built a 30x60 pixels led panel, using Ws2812b strips. I
programmed the led panel graphics using Python, in a way that makes it
easy to combine patterns and functions into new patterns.

# [Maslab](http://maslab.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Team_Six/Final_Paper)

[![img](./jpg/janky.jpg)](./jpg/janky.jpg)

2015- We built Cocoabot, a robot capable of finding cubes on a field and
stacking them by color. Cocoabot had around 10.000 lines of C++11 code,
split in 10 threads, running in an Intel Edison.

I was responsible for integrating the modules, writing the skeleton code
for the threads, designing the state machine and the motor-controllers
code, debugging the code with GDB and finding memory leaks. Documented
on tinyurl.com/cocoabot.

# L shaped wooden loft

[![img](./jpg/loft640x640.jpg)](./jpg/loft.jpg)

2013- Designed and built an L-shaped wooden loft for me and my roommate during
my first month at MIT. The loft was very stable and at one moment had
over 6 people on top of it jumping and moving to confirm its stability.

# [Olimpíadas Cientificas (Youtube Channel)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUT87IB960L3foyy09gjmtw)

[![img](./png/bonecooc.png)](./png/bonecooc.png)

2012-2015. Youtube channel to spread information about Brazilian Science Olympiads. We interviewed participants of science competitions.

</div>
<div class="portfolio-project">

# [Vida de Olímpico (backup)](https://olimpiadascientificas.org/vida-de-olimpico/ivan.olimpiadascientificas.com/index.html)

[![img](./png/bonecooc.png)](./png/bonecooc.png)

2012-2015 Besides organizing my own personal website about science competitions, I helped other 10 students create and spread their blogs about their science competition experiences. I dare say it was a huge success and many students commented on our blogs saying we provided inspirations to them to take part in science competitions.

</div>
<div class="portfolio-project">

# [Ivan - Vida de Olímpico (backup)](https://olimpiadascientificas.org/vida-de-olimpico/ivan.olimpiadascientificas.com/index.html)

[![img](./png/bonecooc.png)](./png/bonecooc.png)

2012- 2013. Personal blog with stories about the time when I took part in Science Olympiads. At its peak, it received 50 unique visitors per day and top posts had a few dozen comments. It was created as a way to debunk myths about science olympiads as well as their competitors, as well as a way to stimulate people to take part in science olympiads, specially those from smaller towns around Brazil.   
I was originally from a small town and I didn't know how other people prepared for science competitions, since no one was taking part on them in my hometown. Through my blog I tried to provide a way to help people in similar situations.   
Some of the readers of the blog were later selected to represent Brazil on IBO, IPhO and IOAA, which was awesome.  
There was a problem with the wordpress database and the website went offline after a few years without being maintained; now we have a snapshot of how it was so others can still access it.

# [Olimpíadas Científicas](http://olimpiadascientificas.org/)

[![img](./png/bonecooc.png)](./png/bonecooc.png)

2009- now. First Brazilian website to help high school students and teachers to
participate in Science Olympiads.  
Used to have ∼500 visits per day.  
Made with wordpress.org, migrated to jekyll in 2016 after a problem with
the wordpress website. Dozens of volunteers have helped with the
website, helping provide material, write news and find information about
the competitions.

It was cited by the largest Brazilian newspaper in 2012,
tinyurl.com/ocientificas.
