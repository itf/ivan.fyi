commercialization/profit, the engine is the palce to go, as long is it
in the areas they invest:

-   Advanced Manufacturing
-   Deep Software
-   Energy
-   Internet of Things
-   Biotech & Life Sciences
-   Advanced Materials
-   Robotics
-   Space

# [MIT venture mentoring](vms.mit.edu.)

You don't need to have a technology venture. It can be any area. The
venture can be in the idea bench of lab bench. As long as it is a
business we can take.

You only need to be commited to starting a business. Able to pull it of.
It is a very very practical program, focuses heavily in implementation.
They are not interested in 5 years from now (like the engine), they are
interested in 5 weeks from now. Mentoring in teams, 3 or 4 mentors at a
time. The mentors assign themselves to the students. MIT venture
mentoring commits to a longterm relationship (after you graduate we are
still here for you). They also have rules for the advisors, so you don't
have to worry about advisors with hidden agendas.
