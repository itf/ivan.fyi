This is a reblog from my [old blog](http://olimpiadascientificas.org/vida-de-olimpico/ivan.olimpiadascientificas.com/2013/03/29/i-was-admitted-in-harvard-mit-yale-and-princeton/index.html). The missing college essay that was too personal is the one that was adapted to the <baby_deer.md> post.

Hey there! Today’s post will be in English; I really hope my usual readers won’t mind that.

Now that all the university results were released, I wanted to share my essays – maybe some day they will help someone. And even if they don’t help, I hope someone will find them interesting :).

Sadly I won’t share every essay – some of them are too personal; it wouldn’t be nice if other people read them haha.
