I want this blog to be really light, so, if you've noticed, it doesn't load any javascript when you access it.  

I've had to deal with slow internet connections or very tiny data caps enough times that I would strongly dislike making people load data that they might not be interested just to improve engagement or something.

If you want to read and write comments, you need to click on the comments button in order to load the Disqus javascript.

And talking about Disqus, I've discovered today that by default Disqus does not allow guests to comment. You need to create an account in order to coment. I've just disabled this here, so it should be easier to write comments now.
